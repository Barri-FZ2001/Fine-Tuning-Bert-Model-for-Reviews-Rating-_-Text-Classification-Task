# Fine-Tuning BERT for Review Rating Task

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning a BERT model to predict review ratings. The model is trained on a dataset of review texts, aiming to predict numerical ratings based on the review content.

## Features

- **Data Preparation:** Includes preprocessing and tokenization of review texts.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model using the `transformers` library.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- `transformers` library
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Barri-FZ2001/Fine-Tuning-Bert-Model-for-Reviews-Rating-_-Text-Classification-Task.git
